In this class I have learned topics include: design of a basic CPU on FPGA, instruction pipeline, RISC versus CISC, ALU design, Von Neumann vs Harvard architecture, memory hierarchy, OS support, interrupts, microcontrollers (MCU) versus microprocessors (uP), system buses, peripherals such as hard disk.
